I'm a research analyst at [Motu](http://motu.nz), an economic and public policy research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.
I joined Motu in early 2018 after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury (UC).

My honours thesis analysed the relationship between insurance and saving as tools for hedging future income.
[I received the Sir Frank Holmes Prize](https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank) from the Motu Research and Education Foundation for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.

While at UC I was the teaching assistant for [micro-][e321], [financial][f331] and [quantitative economics][f601].
I also interned within the actuarial consulting team at PwC, and completed a summer research project investigating whether independent risks should be insured together or separately.
The latter became a working paper that I presented at [the 44th EGRIE conference](http://www.egrie.org/annual-seminars?id=69) in London, England.

Further details can be gleaned from [my CV](/assets/cv.pdf) and [LinkedIn profile]({{ site.linkedin-url}}).
