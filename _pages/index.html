      I'm a research analyst at <a href="https://motu.nz">Motu</a>, an economic and public policy research institute in Wellington, New Zealand.

  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>
    I joined Motu in early 2018 after completing a BSc(Hons) in economics and mathematics at the University of Canterbury (UC).
    My honours thesis analysed the relationship between insurance and savings as tools for hedging future income.
    <a href="https://motu.nz/about-us/news/motu-news-december-2016/#frank">I received the Sir Frank Holmes Prize</a> from the Motu Research and Education Foundation for being New Zealand's top undergraduate economics student.
  </p>
  <p>
    While at UC I was the teaching assistant for <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=ECON321&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017">micro-</a>, <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=FINC331&occurrence=17S1(C)&year=2017">financial</a> and <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=FIEC601&occurrence=17SU1(C)&year=2017">quantitative economics</a>.
    I also interned within the actuarial consulting team at PwC, and completed a summer research project investigating whether independent risks should be insured together or separately.
    The latter became a working paper that I presented at <a href="http://www.egrie.org/annual-seminars?id=69">the 44th EGRIE conference</a> in London, UK.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Motu, I'm working with Dave Maré on an empirical project that involves estimating the relatedness and complexity of economic activities using New Zealand census microdata.
    Our work is funded through <a href="https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz">Te Pūnaha Matatini</a>, and contributes to their research on complex economic and social systems.
    I also coordinated a stakeholder dialogue on climate change adaptation within the transport sector as part of the <a href="https://www.deepsouthchallenge.co.nz/dialogues">Deep South National Science Challenge</a>.
