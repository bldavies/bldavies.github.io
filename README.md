# I'm Ben Davies.

I recently completed a BSc(Hons) in Economics and Mathematics at the [University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz), and will join [Motu Economic and Public Policy Research](http://motu.nz) as a Research Analyst in early 2018.

I plan to develop this site over the coming month(s). In the meantime, readers are welcome to

* explore my current projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bldavies) or
* follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bl.davies/).
